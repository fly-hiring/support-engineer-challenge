Hi <customer_name>,

The unhealthy response indicates that fly.io failed to deploy your application due to unhealthy allocation of resources.
->To solve this check your application logs 
->check the dependencies that is required too run the appliaction is properly installed
->test your application locally to find out what was the exact error
->review your configuration again before deployment.

If the issue persists after trying the above steps, please let us know.

Thank you,
Sandip
